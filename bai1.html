    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
    <p class="h3">
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage
    </p>
    <p class="hh33">
        With CSS, you can control the color,font,the size of text,the spacing between elements,how elements are positioned and laid out,what
        <br>backgroud images or backgroud colors are to be used ,different devices and screen sizes,and much more!
    </p>
    <p id="tip1"><b>Tip:</b> the word <b>cascading</b> means that style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the paren.So,if you
    <br>set the color of the body text to "blue",all headings,paragraphs,and other text element within the body will also get the same color(unless
    <br>you specify something else)!</p>
